Fingerpaint Flow is a casual creator where users can create their own fingerpaint art. To access this casual creator, click on the link to the website: [Fingerpaint Flow](https://nicolenigro.github.io/casual-creator/).

## Overview
### What are your users casually creating?
My users are casually creating fingerprint art. Fingerprint painting was a craft I loved to do when I was younger. However, fingerprint painting requires physical materials like paint and paper and can also get messy. My casual creator encourages users to embrace their inner child and create fingerprint art in an easy and accessible way.

### How do you keep them engaged and excited to create?

### How do you help them make something they are proud to share?

## Personal Meaning
This project is meaningful to me because since my casual creator is available via GitHub pages, I am able to share my work with family and friends.

## Challenges
I pushed myself outside of my comfort zone by embedding my Processing sketch within a website. I really enjoy web design and my prior experiences in Human-Computer Interaction taught me so much about web development, so I knew I wanted to push myself to make my Processing casual creator available via a website. However, this was a tricky process. I found a [helpful article](https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/cs101/processing_on_the_web/) and I followed the instructions, but I kept getting errors and my Processing sketch would not load on my GitHub pages website. I inspected the website (a debugging tool I learned in HCI) to see what the errors were; the error had to do with load image. Through this iterative process of testing my website, inspecting for bugs, and then going back to Processing to make edits, I persevered and created the end product I envisioned. This was an important challenge for me because it strengthened my web development debugging/troubleshooting skills. I also got experience working with multiple languages at once and identifying how they all come together in one product. The next steps for me are to continue honing my web development skills as it’s a career path I’m extremely interested in.
