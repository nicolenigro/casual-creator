# Fingerpaint Flow
Fingerpaint Flow is a casual creator where users can create their own fingerpaint art. To access this casual creator, click on the link to the website: [Fingerpaint Flow](https://nicolenigro.github.io/casual-creator/).

## Overview
### What are your users casually creating?
My users are casually creating fingerprint art. Fingerprint painting was a craft I loved to do when I was younger. However, fingerprint painting requires physical materials like paint and paper and can also get messy. My casual creator encourages users to embrace their inner child and create fingerprint art in an easy and accessible way.

### How do you keep them engaged and excited to create?
My system keeps users engaged and excited to create by establishing a flow state as they create, hence the name Fingerpaint Flow. One of the components of flow is [“immediate feedback”]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), which I incorporated by having my system immediately respond to users; when a user clicks on the canvas, a fingerprint shows up immediately. Another component of flow is [“a sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)); since the fingerprint is painted wherever the user clicks on the canvas, my hope is that they experience personal control over their painting. Also, the clear key and pause key grant users the control to take a break or start over, as they see fit. The final component of flow I incorporated in my system is [“feeling the potential to succeed”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Fingerpainting is an art that is less concerned with form/technique and more so focused on personal fulfillment; by the nature of this approach, I hope all users feel like they can succeed in creating art they’re proud of.

My system makes the experience continuously surprising with the bottommost “paint”—multicolor mode. This “paint” is represented by a circle of different colored concentric circles, which I anticipate will pique user’s curiosity because it is visually unique from the rest of the color palette. When users click on the multicolor mode “paint,” my system will generate a different color for each fingerprint, creating a really unique visual/color effect.

### How do you help them make something they are proud to share?

## Personal Meaning
This system is personally meaningful to me because fingerpainting is a nostalgic hobby from my childhood and my system imbues it with my present day passion for coding and web development. One way I expressed my creativity when I was younger was through fingerpainting. I loved experimenting with different colors to depict my own interpretation of my surroundings, creating fingerpaint art of the sky and park. Fingerpainting was so satisfying because I was literally using my own fingerprint to create, making me feel like I had artistic autonomy. Creating a system that adapts one of my favorite childhood crafts in an online/digital context was a meaningful, empowering experience; I have grown older and have new skills so I can reimagine new ways of engaging in creative expression.

Since my casual creator is available as a website via GitHub pages, I am able to share my work with my family and friends, which has been personally meaningful for me as a developer. A lot of my past projects require users to download the code and run commands in the terminal, which can be a difficult process for people without technical experience. I knew that I wanted to build a website precisely for this reason: to make my casual creator accessible to friends and family and therefore help them be creative. It has been so meaningful for me to send my website link to friends and family and hear their feedback and positive experiences.

## Challenges
I pushed myself outside of my comfort zone by embedding my Processing sketch within a website. I really enjoy web design and my prior experiences in Human-Computer Interaction taught me so much about web development, so I knew I wanted to push myself to make my Processing casual creator available via a website. However, this was a tricky process. I found a [helpful article](https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/cs101/processing_on_the_web/) and I followed the instructions, but I kept getting errors and my Processing sketch would not load on my GitHub pages website. I inspected the website (a debugging tool I learned in HCI) to see what the errors were; the error had to do with load image. Through this iterative process of testing my website, inspecting for bugs, and then going back to Processing to make edits, I persevered and created the end product I envisioned. This was an important challenge for me because it strengthened my web development debugging/troubleshooting skills. I also got experience working with multiple languages at once and identifying how they all come together in one product. The next steps for me are to continue honing my web development skills as it’s a career path I’m extremely interested in.
