# Fingerpaint Fun!

## Overview
https://nicolenigro.github.io/casual-creator/

### What are your users casually creating?

### How do you keep them engaged and excited to create?

### How do you help them make something they are proud to share?

## Personal Meaning
This project is meaningful to me because since my casual creator is available via GitHub pages, I am able to share my work with family and friends.

## Challenges
I have experience with web development from when I took Human-Computer Interaction last spring so I wanted to challenge myself to embed my Processing casual creator into a website. I found a helpful article (see sources) and I followed the instructions, but I kept getting errors and my Processing sketch would not load on the GitHub pages website. I inspected the website to see what the errors were (had to do with load image) and persevered through debugging my code. This was an important challenge for me because it strengthened my web development debugging/troubleshooting skills.
